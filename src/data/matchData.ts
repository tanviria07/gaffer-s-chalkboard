      explanation: {
        whatHappened: "The midfielder slipped a **through ball** between the center-backs. The striker timed his run perfectly and finished near-post.",
        whyItMatters: "This breaks the defensive shape and forces a mistake deep in their defensive third. The defense was caught flat and couldn't recover.",
        nflAnalogy: "That's like a QB threading a **seam pass** between linebackers — the timing window is tiny and closes fast. One split-second late and it's picked off."

      videoTimestamp: 1620,
      explanation: {
        whatHappened: "The defensive line stepped up **in unison** just as the pass was played. The striker was caught a half-step offside.",
        whyItMatters: "A well-executed offside trap is high-risk, high-reward. It nullifies dangerous attacks but requires perfect timing from all four defenders.",
        nflAnalogy: "Think of it like a **zone blitz** where the linebackers drop into coverage at the snap — if everyone reads the play correctly, you create confusion and force a turnover."

      videoTimestamp: 2100,
      explanation: {
        whatHappened: "The winger cut inside and drove a low shot at the **near post**. The keeper was beaten at his near side — a goalkeeper's nightmare.",
        whyItMatters: "Near-post goals are often seen as keeper errors. The goalkeeper should have that angle covered. This shifts momentum completely.",
        nflAnalogy: "It's like a running back hitting an **A-gap** hole that the linebacker should have filled. When you beat someone at their strongest point, it's demoralizing."

      description: 'Tactical foul to stop counter-attack',
      videoTimestamp: 2520,
      explanation: {
        whatHappened: "The midfielder made a **cynical foul** to stop a dangerous counter-attack. He accepted the yellow card to prevent a 3-on-2 break.",
        whyItMatters: "This is a 'professional foul' — trading a booking for preventing a high-quality scoring chance. The math usually works out.",
        nflAnalogy: "Exactly like an **intentional holding** penalty when a defender is beat. You take the 10 yards instead of giving up the touchdown."

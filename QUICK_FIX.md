# ✅ Backend Server Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
- Port 8000 was already in use by another service
- Backend server wasn't running
- Frontend was showing stub responses because it couldn't connect

## What I Fixed
1. ✅ Changed backend to port 8001
2. ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` to point to port 8001
3. ✅ Started the backend server on port 8001
4. ✅ Verified server is running and healthy

## Next Steps - DO THIS NOW:

### 1. Restart Your Frontend
Stop the current frontend (Ctrl+C) and restart it:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Refresh Your Browser
- Open `http://localhost:8080` (or whatever port your frontend uses)
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Ctrl+F5`

### 3. Test the Connection
- Paste a YouTube URL
- Click "Analyze Now" or wait for automatic analysis
- You should now see **real analysis** instead of stub responses!

## Verify Backend is Running

Open in browser: `http://localhost:8001/health`

Should show:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "gaffer-agent",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## If You Still See Stub Responses

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Check backend terminal** for any error messages
3. **Verify backend is running**: `http://localhost:8001/health`
4. **Check network tab** in browser DevTools - look for `/api/analyze` requests

## To Start Backend Manually (if needed)

```powershell
cd agent
$env:PORT=8001
python main.py
```

Or edit `agent/.env` and set `PORT=8001`, then run `python main.py`

---

**The backend is now running on port 8001!** 🎉

  counter: `At {timestamp}, this is a classic **counter-attack** — like a pick-six! The team just won the ball and is sprinting upfield before the defense can reset. Speed and decision-making are everything here.`,
  setpiece: `At {timestamp}, we've got a **set-piece** situation. This is like a special teams play — everyone has a specific assignment. The attacking team has rehearsed routes, the defense is in zone coverage trying to win the aerial battle.`,
  goal: `At {timestamp}, that's a **touchdown moment**! The buildup created the opening, and the finish was clinical. Like a perfectly executed red zone play — spacing, timing, and execution all came together.`,
  defensive: `At {timestamp}, the defense is in a **compact shape** — similar to a prevent defense. They're protecting the middle, forcing play wide, and making sure no one gets behind the back line.`,
  movement: `At {timestamp}, watch the **off-ball movement** — it's like receivers running routes. The player without the ball is creating space, dragging defenders, and opening passing lanes for teammates.`,
  buildup: `At {timestamp}, the team is in a **buildup phase** — like a methodical drive down the field. Short passes, maintaining possession, waiting for the defense to make a mistake or create an opening.`,
  default: `At {timestamp}, we're seeing a tactical sequence unfold. Think of it like a well-designed play — every player has a role. The team with the ball is probing for weaknesses, while the defense is reading and reacting.`,

// Beginner-friendly responses
const BEGINNER_RESPONSES = {
  pressing: `At {timestamp}, the defending team is **pressing** — they're running toward the player with the ball to try to win it back quickly. It's aggressive but risky; if they don't win the ball, they leave space behind.`,
  counter: `At {timestamp}, this is a **counter-attack**! One team just lost the ball, and now the other team is racing forward while the defense is out of position. It's all about speed right now.`,
  setpiece: `At {timestamp}, we have a **set-piece** — a corner, free kick, or throw-in. The game stops and both teams set up in specific positions. It's a great chance to score from a rehearsed play.`,
  goal: `At {timestamp}, **GOAL!** The attacking team found an opening and took their chance. Watch the buildup — the passes, the movement — everything led to that moment.`,
  defensive: `At {timestamp}, the team without the ball is **defending deep**. They're staying close together, not letting attackers get behind them, and waiting for a chance to win the ball back.`,
  movement: `At {timestamp}, notice the **movement** — players running into space even without the ball. This creates confusion for defenders and opens up passing options.`,
  buildup: `At {timestamp}, the team is **building up slowly** — short passes, keeping the ball safe, looking for an opening. Patience is key here; they're waiting for the right moment to attack.`,
  default: `At {timestamp}, the team with the ball is trying to create a chance. They're passing, moving, and looking for gaps. The defense is organized and trying to block any clear opportunities.`,

// Tactical responses
const TACTICAL_RESPONSES = {
  pressing: `At {timestamp}, we're seeing a **coordinated press** with clear trigger points. The front line initiates when the ball goes to a specific zone, midfielders step up to cut passing lanes. The defensive line pushes high to compress space — classic gegenpressing principles.`,
  counter: `At {timestamp}, the team is executing a **vertical transition**. Upon winning possession, they immediately look for the forward pass into space. Notice the wide players stretching the recovering defensive line — this is transition football at its best.`,
  setpiece: `At {timestamp}, this **set-piece** shows interesting structural choices. The attacking team is using near-post runners to disrupt zonal markers, with late runners targeting the back post. The defensive setup appears to be a hybrid man-zonal system.`,
  goal: `At {timestamp}, the **goal sequence** demonstrates key principles: width to stretch the defense, patient buildup through the thirds, and clinical finishing. The final ball exploited the gap between the center-backs created by the striker's movement.`,
  defensive: `At {timestamp}, the team is in a **mid-to-low block**, maintaining horizontal compactness of about 35 meters. They're denying central access, forcing play wide, and the back four is holding a disciplined line.`,
  movement: `At {timestamp}, the **off-ball movement** is creating overloads in the half-spaces. The #10 is dropping to receive between lines while the #8 makes a blind-side run. This rotation is pulling the defensive structure apart.`,
  buildup: `At {timestamp}, classic **positional play** in the buildup phase. The center-backs split wide, the #6 drops to create a back-three, and the fullbacks push high. They're looking to progress through the thirds with controlled possession.`,
  default: `At {timestamp}, we're in a **phase of play** transition. The team in possession is probing the defensive block, looking for gaps between the lines. The key battle is in the half-spaces — the channels between the center and the flanks.`,
